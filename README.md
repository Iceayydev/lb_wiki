Concerns over free, personal use of educational indexes is growing, especially in institutions.
The aim of the project is to use existing file transfer protocols to distribute already existing data. The reasoning for this is because much of this data is either copy written or sensitive in the sense it cannot effectively be hosted publicly (you get the idea).

The goal is to make the usage of this service as easy and comprehensive as possible.

# Feasibility
Assuming it is required every host in some area shares some percentage of the total cluster, we might as well call it quits right here.
That assumes this "cluster" already contains all desired data, and properly installed streams for more current information.

## Go Progressive
My solution for this is to not immediately include every branch of science and field of whatever at once. The proof of concept for this project revolved around an accessible pharmacology index. Starting from this point will hopefully allow for contributors (that's a potential Y O U) to join and propagate the existing information.

# No wrappers
I've learned my lesson. I'm sorry.
